# iKARMA - Kernel Driver Analysis for Memory Forensics

iKARMA is a specialized memory forensics tool designed to identify and analyze potentially dangerous kernel drivers in Windows memory dumps. 

This project was developed by PA-G27 for our module ICT3215 Digital Forensics.

## Key Features

- **Volatility3 + PE Carving**: Full integration with Volatility3 for structured memory analysis with PE carving fallback.
- **BYOVD / Dangerous API Detection**: IOCTL handler scanner runs by default; console/HTML highlight BYOVD hits with explainable evidence.
- **Cross-View Validation**: PsLoadedModuleList vs DRIVER_OBJECT scan to spot hidden/remnant drivers.
- **Hook Detection**: MajorFunction table analysis to detect hooked handlers
- **Legitimacy Bonus**: Reduced risk scores for Microsoft/WHQL signed drivers
- **LOLDrivers Intel**: Matches against known vulnerable drivers and surfaces CVEs/descriptions.
- **"Because" Tags**: Every finding includes forensic-defensible evidence strings
- **SIEM-Ready JSON**: Consistent schema for security orchestration integration
